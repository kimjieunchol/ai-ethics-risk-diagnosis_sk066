Since these models learn from vast amounts of internet data, they can reflect and amplify existing societal prejudices, including racial, gender, and ideological biases. This has raised concerns about misinformation, stereotyping, and ethical responsibility in AI-generated content.

In the United States, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited discriminatory employment practices, while the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974 extended these principles to lending. These laws implicitly advanced the idea of statistical parity: practices that result in disproportionate exclusion of protected groups are considered unfair, regardless of [...] While these legal frameworks prohibit practices that violate AI fairness, they lack formal definitions of fairness, leaving room for ambiguity.

Let’s imagine we’ve identified that our company is only subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) — can ChatGPT write a privacy policy that complies with it?\n\nThe result? The privacy policy is missing necessary GDPR requirements and is NOT compliant.\n\nTake a look at what ChatGPT gave me below:\n\nUnfortunately, this is not a GDPR-compliant privacy policy. [...] |  |  |  |\n --- \n| GDPR Article | GDPR Requirements | ChatGPT Generated Privacy Policy |\n| Articles 13 1(a)   (Information to be provided where personal data are collected from the data subject) | Identity and contact details of the Company. | Partially Compliant   The company contact details are not provided |\n| Article 13 1(b) | Contact details of the data protection officer (DPO). | Not Compliant | [...] As you can see from the red text in the table above, the ChatGPT privacy policy is far from complying with every requirement of the GDPR.\n\nMoreover, the information generated is not guaranteed to be correct.\n\nFor example, if you read through Section 2, ‘How We Use Your Information’, many purposes legally applicable to Termly are simply missing.\n\nThis is because ChatGPT is generating text using other pre-existing policies as a reference — it’s not based on any of our actual business practices.",

The data protection-compliant use of ChatGPT 3.5 and 4 in corporate environments is only possible if no personal data within the meaning of Art. 4 (1) GDPR is processed and no protected trade secrets are disclosed. [...] However, OpenAI does not provide a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) or a data processing agreement for the free versions 3.5 and 4 of ChatGPT.\n\nWithout a valid data processing agreement, the processing of personal data within the meaning of Art. 4 (1) GDPR is not lawful in the context of the use of ChatGPT 3.5 and 4. Therefore, it is not possible for companies wishing to process personal data to use these versions of ChatGPT for this.\n\n### Processing activity for training purposes [...] When integrating ChatGPT 3.5 or 4 into company processes, ChatGPT or OpenAI as its provider would actually be considered a data processor within the meaning of the GDPR.
