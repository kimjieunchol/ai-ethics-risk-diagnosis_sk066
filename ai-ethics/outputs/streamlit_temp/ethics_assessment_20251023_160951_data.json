In an attempt to promote inclusivity, their efforts went too far and actually generated images that deviated from history.2 For example, images were recreated to replicate Nazi soldiers and the founding fathers but instead of accurate imagery, they used people of color to promote inclusivity.3 Many individuals believe that this is an attempt at correction but resulted in an overcorrection to the long standing racial bias issues embedded in",

Style Interpretation: The model interprets artistic cues, moods, lighting and composition from your prompt and any style references. [...] 4. Image Generation: It creates four initial image variations. You can upscale one to a higher resolution vary it for similar outputs and edit specific parts using tools like Vary (Region) or the web editor.\n5. Refinement Options: You can use parameters or reference images to control the look, layout and subject with more precision.\n6.

Bias refers to the systematic and consistent deviation of an algorithm’s output from the true value or from what would be expected in the absence of bias .
