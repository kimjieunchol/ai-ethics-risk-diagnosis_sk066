The use of 'dark patterns' in the consent interface, such as pre-checked toggles for data sharing, directly conflicts with GDPR guidelines, which require clear and unambiguous consent. While Claude AI does not use user prompts or responses for training without permission, the interface design may mislead users into consenting unintentionally. Additionally, the lack of explicit data residency assurances for EU users poses a compliance risk. Despite these issues, Claude AI offers data processing agreements for business users to ensure GDPR compliance and maintains minimal data retention, which are positive aspects of its privacy practices.",
