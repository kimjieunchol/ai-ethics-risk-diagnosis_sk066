          "content": "One way to handle DALL-E 2’s bias issues would be to exclude the ability to generate human faces altogether, says Hannah Rose Kirk, a data scientist at Oxford University who participated in the red team process. She coauthored research earlier this year about how to reduce bias in multimodal models like OpenAI’s CLIP, and recommends DALL-E 2 adopt a classification model that limits the system’s ability to generate images that perpetuate stereotypes. [...] Another red team member, who asked WIRED not to use their name due to concerns about possible retribution, said that while they found the OpenAI ethics team to be responsive to concerns, they were against releasing DALL-E 2 with the ability to generate faces. They question the rush to release technology that can automate discrimination. [...] DALL-E’s creators call the model experimental and not yet fit for commercial use but say it could influence industries like art, education, and marketing and help advance OpenAI’s stated goal of creating artificial general intelligence. But by OpenAI’s own admission, DALL-E 2 is more racist and sexist than a similar, smaller model.

A vast amount of data is needed to train image generation models, and it is difficult to filter out all potentially racist and misogynistic data scraped from the internet. Models from other generative AI companies like Stability AI, DALL-E, and Midjourney have all struggled to depict Black women, according to artists. [...] Early iterations of OpenAI’s image generation model DALL·E highlighted this problem. In 2022, when prompted with the word “CEO,” 97% of the images produced were of White men. When asked to depict a “nurse,” the results were disproportionately female. These outcomes reflect statistical patterns in historically representative but inherently biased training data.\n\nSource: VICE [...] The regulatory push around algorithmic fairness has its roots in civil rights law and anti-discrimination statutes from the 20th century. In the United States, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited discriminatory employment practices, while the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974 extended these principles to lending. These laws implicitly advanced the idea of statistical parity: practices that result in disproportionate exclusion of protected groups are considered unfair, regardless of",

A typical example is as follows: [...] ## Images of individuals: Another diversity failure\n\nUsing a prompt specifically designed to elicit an image of only one person illustrates another problem.

These laws implicitly advanced the idea of statistical parity: practices that result in disproportionate exclusion of protected groups are considered unfair, regardless of [...] While these legal frameworks prohibit practices that violate AI fairness, they lack formal definitions of fairness, leaving room for ambiguity.

  "comparison_analysis": "## 종합적인 비교 분석\n\n### 1. 전체 평가 순위\n- **DALL-E**: 종합 점수 3.4, 전체 위험 수준 \"중간\"\n- **Midjourney**: 종합 점수 2.8, 전체 위험 수준 \"중간\"\n\nDALL-E가 Midjourney보다 전반적으로 높은 점수를 받았습니다. 이는 DALL-E가 여러 윤리적 차원에서 더 나은 성과를 보였음을 나타냅니다.\n\n### 2. 차원별 비교\n\n#### 공정성\n- **DALL-E**: 점수 3. DALL-E는 편향성 문제를 인식하고 이를 완화하기 위한 조치를 취하고 있지만, 여전히 성별 및 인종 편향이 존재합니다. OpenAI는 투명성을 유지하고 있으며, 필터링 시스템을 통해 부적절한 콘텐츠를 줄이려는 노력을 하고 있습니다.\n- **Midjourney**: 점수 2. Midjourney는 인종 및 성별 표현에서 편향 문제가 두드러지며, 체계적인 편향 테스트 및 완화 전략이 부족합니다. 공정성에 대한 명확한 가이드라인이 부족합니다.\n\n#### 개인정보 보호\n- **DALL-E**: 점수 3. GDPR 준수를 위해 데이터 보호 조치를 취하고 있지만, 데이터 최소화 및 목적 제한에 대한 명확성이 부족합니다.\n- **Midjourney**: 점수 3. GDPR 준수 및 사용자 데이터 삭제 요청을 허용하지만, 데이터 처리 관행의 투명성이 부족하고 사용자 불만이 제기되었습니다.\n\n#### 투명성\n- **DALL-E**: 점수 4. OpenAI는 기술 문서 및 연구 논문을 통해 높은 수준의 투명성을 유지하고 있습니다. 그러나 모델의 의사 결정 과정에 대한 설명은 여전히 복잡합니다.\n- **Midjourney**: 점수 3. 기본적인 정보는 제공하지만, 의사 결정 과정 및 모델 매개변수에 대한 세부 정보가 부족합니다.\n\n#### 책임성\n- **DALL-E**: 점수 4. 강력한 거버넌스 구조와 투명성을 통해 높은 책임성을 보여줍니다. 그러나 편향 문제는 여전히 개선이 필요합니다.\n- **Midjourney**: 점수 3. GDPR 준수 및 사용자 피드백을 수용하지만, 명확한 거버넌스 구조와 책임성에 대한 세부 정보가 부족합니다.\n\n#### 안전성\n- **DALL-E**: 점수 3. 편향 문제로 인해 안전성에 대한 우려가 있으며, 추가적인 개선이 필요합니다.\n- **Midjourney**: 점수 3. 콘텐츠 모더레이션 및 커뮤니티 가이드라인을 통해 기본적인 안전성을 유지하지만, 편향 문제와 사이버 보안 조치가 부족합니다.\n\n### 3. 모범 사례\n**DALL-E의 투명성**은 가장 우수한 사례로 꼽을 수 있습니다. OpenAI는 기술 문서와 연구 논문을 통해 모델의 구조와 기능을 명확히 설명하며, 이는 사용자 신뢰 구축에 기여합니다.\n\n### 4. 개선 필요 영역\n두 서비스 모두 **편향 문제**에서 개선이 필요합니다. 특히 인종 및 성별 표현에서의 편향은 공통적인 취약점으로, 더 체계적인 테스트와 완화 전략이 필요합니다.\n\n### 5. 산업 트렌드\nAI 윤리 수준은 점차 중요해지고 있으며, 투명성과 책임성에 대한 요구가 증가하고 있습니다. GDPR과 같은 규제 준수는 기본적인 요구사항이 되었으며, 공정성과 안전성에 대한 관심이 높아지고 있습니다.\n\n### 6. 차별화 요소\n- **DALL-E**: OpenAI의 투명성과 책임성에 대한 강력한 접근은 DALL-E의 차별화된 요소입니다. 기술 문서와 연구 논문을 통해 사용자가 모델의 기능을 이해할 수 있도록 돕습니다.\n- **Midjourney**: Midjourney는 AI를 통한 창의적 가능성 확장에 중점을 두고 있으며, 사용자 피드백을 통해 플랫폼을 개선하려는 노력을 기울이고 있습니다.\n\n이 분석은 각 서비스의 강점과 약점을 명확히 드러내며, 개선이 필요한 영역을 강조합니다. AI 윤리의 중요성이 증가하는 가운데, 이러한 평가 결과는 서비스 제공자들이 더 나은 윤리적 기준을 달성하는 데 기여할 것입니다."
